# Android CLI

[Android CLI](https://thedinkardubey.github.io/Android-CLI-Website/) is a terminal emulator app built with React Native that allows users to execute various commands on their Android device's file system.

## Features

- **Command Execution**: Execute various commands such as `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `append`, `open`, `touch`, `cat`, `rm`, `echo`, `clear`, `date`, `whoami`, `exit`, and `help`.
- **Command History**: View and navigate through the command history.
- **Auto-Complete**: Basic auto-complete functionality suggests commands as users type.
- **File System Access**: Access and manipulate files and directories on the device.
